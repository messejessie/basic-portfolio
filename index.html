            G'day, my name is Jessie Duncan.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a soon to be web developer who likes long walks on the moon and taking star trips to Mars in the
            summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            All jokes aside I am a current graduate of the UCF College of Science with a Bachlors in Psychology. Also a
            soon be a graduate of the UCF Coding Bootcamp.
            I have a passion for space and earth. I've always wanted to make this earth a better place. Electric cars
            and air craft is one of the many ways we can accomplish this.
            I still passion for personal development and mental health education since my first degree focuses so much
            on this. I hope this new skill set will allow me to create better tools to teach emotion and effective
            behavior modification at a young age.
