            G'day, my name is Jessie Duncan. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            I am a soon to be web developer who likes long walks on the moon and blasting off to mars on my local Tesla Roaster. 
            All jokes aside I am a current graduate of the UCF College of Science with a Bachlors in Psychology. Also a soon be a graduate of the UCF Coding Bootcamp.
            I have a passion for space and earth. I've always wanted to make this earth a better place. Electric cars and air craft is one of the many ways we can accomplish this. 
            I still passion for personal development and mental health education since my first degree focuses so much on this. I hope this new skill set will allow me to create better tools to teach emotion and effective behavior modification at a young age.
